\section*{Background Remarks on Computing Resources}

\begin{enumerate}
\item I have a cluster with 120 cores and 640GB RAM total at
  University of Washington, which we can use.  

\item I have an account on a supercomputer running Linux with about
  15,000 hours allocated, which we can use.  These use Sun Grid
  Engine, so you submit a job (some script to run), and it runs within
  about 1 day, usually.  (Note that 15,000 hours is actually the same
  as what my cluster can do in 5 days.  But maybe we can use 15,000 hours in one day on the supercomputer.)
\end{enumerate}


\section{A Question of Barry Mazur about classical modular forms}

This involves gathering arithmetic statistics about a question that
Barry Mazur asked me a week ago, which via some arguments reduced to 
an easy-to-state question about classical modular forms of level one.
Thus this is particularly accessible.


\section{The first elliptic curve over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ of rank 3}
This project is to find the first elliptic curve over $F=\Q(\sqrt{5})$ of rank 3,
assuming all standard conjectures about elliptic curves over $F$, i.e,. assuming
modularity and the BSD conjecture.  The outline is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Enumerate all rational newforms of norm conductor up to $26569=163^2$ to
sufficient precision that we can compute $\ord_{s=1}(L(f,s))$.
\item Compute $r_f = \ord_{s=1}(L(f,s))$.
\item If there is an $f$ with norm conductor $<26569$ with $\ord_{s=1}(L(f,s))=3$, find a corresponding Weierstrass equation.
\item Collect statistics about the integers $r_f$.
\end{enumerate}
The current rank records are:

0 & 31 (prime) &  $[1,a+1,a,a,0]$ &  Dembele \\
